To do next:

- In literature review, situate the dissertation around globalization->democracy and democracy->globalization.

- Highlight how I consider media both as an independent variable (shaping perceptions and welfare outcomes) and dependent variable (shaped by economic liberalization and levels of openness.)

- Align language throughout intro
	- argue, posit, test, find


- Switch ordering of Articles 2 and 3.
- make all three chapter summaries consistent in how much they foreshadow of findings

- Conclusion will be focused on implications.
	- Globalization and democracy
		- Welfare as a subset of democracy

- do fine tuning in april
- presentation (Rosie says ~20min, Orfeo says 3-5 min)
