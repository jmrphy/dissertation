what i will do for rosie

- As Chris and Orfeo and you all agreed, I've written the introduction to be far more conservative and narrow and succint and focused.
	- I'm very aware I was taking some liberties, so basically there are several sentences you question and I've simply removed them all.

- In literature review, situate the dissertation around globalization->democracy and democracy->globalization.

- Highlight how I consider media both as an independent variable (shaping perceptions and welfare outcomes) and dependent variable (shaped by economic liberalization and levels of openness.)

- Switch ordering of Articles 2 and 3.

- Conclusion will be focused on implications.
	- Globalization and democracy
		- Welfare as a subset of democracy

Rosie you say "I suggest starting with a clear puzzle or set of puzzles."
- Introduction will lead with puzzles, the very first paragraph is a series of questions.

Rosie you say: "simply lay out the different sides of the debate about the role of the media and then jump right into how media fits into the globalization and the state debates. Straightforwardly state that media has been viewed as positively (empowerment/ watchdog) and negatively (propaganda)."

Are there any expectations you have for my performance on the day of, which I should be aware of?
